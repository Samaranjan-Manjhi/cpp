I graduated with a Bachelor's in Computer Engineering from [Shree LR Tiwari College of Engineering], which is located in [Mira Road, Thane (E)] in 2023. I'm a passionate software developer with over 2 years of experience in the IT industry.
I have strong skills in C, C++, Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA), and system-level programming and experience working with Qt to build cross-platform applications. I’m comfortable working in Linux and macOS environments and use tools like Xcode and Git for version control. I enjoy solving challenges and creating efficient, high-quality software. I’m always excited to learn new technologies and take on projects where I can make a real impact.
