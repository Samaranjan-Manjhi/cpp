###C++ Tutorial

#What is C++?
C++ is a general-purpose programming language that was developed by Bjarne Stroustrup at Bell Labs in the early 1980s. The C++ language is an extension to the C language and provides several additional features, such as object-oriented programming, exception handling, and templates. It is mainly used to create system software, high-performance applications, embedded systems, game development, GUI, and many other applications.
     #A general-purpose programming language (GPL) is a programming language designed to be broadly applicable across a wide variety of application domains and to solve a wide array of computing problems, rather than being limited to a specific area like a domain-specific language (DSL). Examples include languages like Python, Java, C, and JavaScript, which can be used for tasks such as web development, scientific computing, game creation, and more.


#Features of C++
There are several features of the C++ programming language. Some of them are as follows:

    It is an object-oriented, procedural, and middle-level programming language.
    C++ is used to create high-level applications.
    It is a highly preferred programming language that is used for cross-platform applications.
    It is compatible with multiple platforms.
    It supports both operator overloading and function overloading.
    It offers low-level memory manipulation with pointers.
    It provides several built-in functions and operators.

# using namespace std;
using namespace std; is a C++ statement that brings all names from the std (standard) namespace into the current scope, allowing you to use standard library components like cout and cin without the std:: prefix. While convenient for beginners and small programs by reducing typing, it's generally considered bad practice in larger projects because it can cause name collisions and makes code less clear by potentially obscuring where an identifier originates from. For better practice, you should use the scope resolution operator (::) to explicitly specify the namespace (e.g., std::cout) or use a selective using declaration (e.g., using std::cout;)

#Why Learn C++?
It includes several features of procedural, object-oriented, and generic programming languages that help to write efficient, reusable, and flexible code. These excellent features make it a better choice for developing system software, GUI, and several other applications. Here we have described some of the main advantages of learning C++:

    C++ is an easy-to-learn and implement.
    It offers Cross-Platform Support that enables you to run C++ programs on multiple operating systems.
    Using C++, developers can develop system software, game development applications and many others.
    It provides a large community and resources.

#Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
C++ supports object-oriented programming, and the four major pillars of object-oriented programming (OOP) used in C++ are:

    Inheritance
    Polymorphism
    Encapsulation
    Abstraction

#C++ Standard Libraries
Standard C++ programming is divided into three important parts:

    The core library includes the data types, variables, literals, etc.
    The standard library includes a set of functions that manipulate strings, files, and many others.
    The STL includes a set of methods to manipulate a data structure.

#Usage of C++
With the help of the C++ programming language, you can develop different types of secure and robust applications. Some of them are as follows:

    Window application
    Client-Server application
    Device drivers
    Embedded firmware etc

###Difference between C and C++

#Definition
C is a structural programming language, and it does not support classes and objects. On the other hand, C++ is an object-oriented programming language that supports the concept of classes and objects.

#Type of programming language
C supports the structural programming language where the code is checked line by line. On the other hand, C++ is an object-oriented programming language that supports the concept of classes and objects.

#Developer of the language
Dennis Ritchie developed C language at Bell Laboratories. On the other hand, Bjarne Stroustrup developed the C++ language at Bell Labs circa 1980.

#Subset
C++ is a superset of C programming language. C++ can run 99% of C code but C language cannot run C++ code.

#Security
In C, the data can be easily manipulated by the outsiders as it does not support the encapsulation and information hiding while C++ is a very secure language, i.e., no outsiders can manipulate its data as it supports both encapsulation and data hiding. In C language, functions and data are the free entities, and in C++ language, all the functions and data are encapsulated in the form of objects.

#Function Overloading
Function overloading is a feature that allows us to have more than one function with the same name but varies in the parameters. C does not support the function overloading, while C++ supports the function overloading.

#Function Overriding
Function overriding is a feature that provides the specific implementation to the function, which is already defined in the base class. C does not support the function overriding. On the other hand, C++ supports the function overriding.

#Keywords
C contains 32 keywords, and C++ supports 52 keywords.

#Namespace feature
A namespace is a feature that groups the entities like classes, objects, and functions under some specific name. C does not contain the namespace feature, while C++ supports the namespace feature that avoids the name collisions.

#Exception handling
C does not provide direct support to the exception handling; it needs to use functions that support exception handling. C++ provides direct support to exception handling by using a try-catch block.

#Input/Output functions
In C, scanf and printf functions are used for input and output operations, respectively, while in C++, cin and cout are used for input and output operations, respectively.

#Memory allocation and de-allocation
C supports calloc() and malloc() functions for the memory allocation, and free() function for the memory de-allocation. On the other hand, C++ supports a new operator for the memory allocation and delete operator for the memory de-allocation.

#Header file
C program uses <stdio.h> header file while C++ program uses <iostream.h> header file.
