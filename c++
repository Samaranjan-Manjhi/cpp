What is C++?

C++ is a general-purpose programming language that was developed by Bjarne Stroustrup at Bell Labs in the early 1980s. The C++ language is an extension to the C language and provides several additional features, such as object-oriented programming, exception handling, and templates. It is mainly used to create system software, high-performance applications, embedded systems, game development, GUI, and many other applications.
     
     #A general-purpose programming language (GPL) is a programming language designed to be broadly applicable across a wide variety of application domains and to solve a wide array of computing problems, rather than being limited to a specific area like a domain-specific language (DSL). Examples include languages like Python, Java, C, and JavaScript, which can be used for tasks such as web development, scientific computing, game creation, and more.


Features of C++

There are several features of the C++ programming language. Some of them are as follows:

    It is an object-oriented, procedural, and middle-level programming language.
    C++ is used to create high-level applications.
    It is a highly preferred programming language that is used for cross-platform applications.
    It is compatible with multiple platforms.
    It supports both operator overloading and function overloading.
    It offers low-level memory manipulation with pointers.
    It provides several built-in functions and operators.

# using namespace std;
using namespace std; is a C++ statement that brings all names from the std (standard) namespace into the current scope, allowing you to use standard library components like cout and cin without the std:: prefix. While convenient for beginners and small programs by reducing typing, it's generally considered bad practice in larger projects because it can cause name collisions and makes code less clear by potentially obscuring where an identifier originates from. For better practice, you should use the scope resolution operator (::) to explicitly specify the namespace (e.g., std::cout) or use a selective using declaration (e.g., using std::cout;)
